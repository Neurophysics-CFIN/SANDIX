Usage is free, but please cite this publication.

The main function is fitwrapper.m, which allows to fit a handfuld of model variants, SMEX, SMEX-dot, SANDIX and eSANDIX. Notably, the scripts take into account a finite diffusion gradient pulse width. A good place to start is the demo in fittingexample.m, which showcases the usage with a small example data set. 

The function plotlandscape can be used to visualize the fitting landscape (cost function) for a given signal. See landscape_example to learn how to use it.
